<h1> Welcome to Assignment 2 </h1>
<br />
<p> This is assignment 2. Im gonna make this rather interesting to say the least.
  At least, I hope its interesting lol. You are reading the first paragraph, but of course I like
to put in a barage of them in my work. You know what else I like to put in my work? Relicanth. What a cute little guy.
relicanth is a fish pokemon and I love him. Oh I am getting off topic. Lets move on </p>
<a name="pagetop"></a>
<br />
<p class="fix"> Also Ill be following you lol </p>
<br />
<h2> The content </h2>
<br />
<p> Lets start with something simple. A list of sorts! Before you is an ordered list, this list is of my 9 favourite
  letters...nothing...fishy...going on </p>
<br />
<ol>
  <li> R </li>
  <li> E </li>
  <li> L </li>
  <li> I </li>
  <li> C </li>
  <li> A </li>
  <li> N </li>
  <li> T </li>
  <li> H </li>
  </ol>
  <br />
<p> What a list am I right?...No?...ok fine maybe I should try something different. Hmmmmmmm. I GOT IT!! An unordered list.
  This list is...um....Just some colours in no particular order i suppose.
  <br />
  <ul>
    <li> Brown </li>
    <li> Beige </li>
    <li> Black </li>
    <li> Red </li>
    </ul>
  <br />
  <p> Was that any better? You know, I figure I spent all this money to come to uni, I might as well have some fun right?
    no? yes? I dont know I cant read your mind, this is all written in the past. You know what else I like to do?
    Story telling. Maybe all these labs and assignments are gonna come together somehow...nah its too late for that.
    Whatever. This is chill. I should probably get on with the assignment I suppose? Well...I have talked so much about
    relicanth, heres an absolute link if you want to learn more lol. </p>
    <br />
    <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Relicanth_(Pok%C3%A9mon)"> relicanth lore </a>
    <br />
    <p> Man Im running out of stuff! Theres only so much I can add to this HTML. A shame is it not, Im sure you
      would love to hear more from me. But at the same time, all this text and what not will be helpful for the anchor
      I suppose...oh yeah the images. Ok I suck with relative images, but Im gonna lock in for it. Ill start with
      the absolute linking. BEHOLD: </p>
      <br />
      <img src="https://images.gameinfo.io/pokemon/256/p369g2s1.png" />
      <br />
      <p> Well im Not submitting this unless that image worked so if are reading this, that image is there.
        For the relative one, Im gonna reeeeally try with this one. Then if it works ill say how long it took me, or
        if i rage quitted. </p>
    <br />
    <img src="relicanth.jpg" />
    <br />
    <p> This is attempt 1. If you are reading this I got it on the first try in like 3 minutes!!! I hope so.
      This was art of my in game character with, suprise, a relicanth. But a blue one this time. I think its cool. </p>
      <br />
  <p> Anyways, heres the relative link. As much as I would looove to hide it as a fun game, I guess I should probably
    not do that...siiigh </p>
    <br />
    <a href="altfile.html"> Click me for the other page I suppose </a>
    <br />
<p> Well, I guess thats it...at least...for this chapter. You see, heres the plot twist, this HTML is spit up
  into 2 chapters. You finished chapter 1, congrats! The next chapter is where all of the CSS stuff comes into play.
  But of course, if you wish to go back to the top of the page for whatever reason, here is your fast travel point: </p>
  <br />
  <a href="sike.html"> Click me for top of page </a>
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <h3> Chapter 2: CSS </h3>
<br />
<p> Lets try this out shall we? alrighty. To start,</p> <p class="bluetext"> Im Blue dabadee dabadie. </p>
<br />
<p class="bigtext"> Im very big </p>
<p class="smalltext"> and Im very small </p>
<br />
<p class="roman"> But me? Im a sheriff of these parts. I think...or was it serif? idk anymore </p>
<br />
<p class="large"> I am yelling extremely loud right now through the computerr raaaah </p>
<br />
<p class="absol"> You see that text at the top thats been following you? Well dont worry, im absolute text so I wont
  be a clingy guy like him. </p>
<br />
<p class="relate"> But me? well Im weird. I aint like none of them. Im relative. Im quirky as the kids say.
40 down and 40 from the left hehe. Im so cool. </p>
<br />
<p class="mark"> Im a special paragraph though. Im not like other paragraphs...im marked. you know because...
  im blue and...marked in the CSS...right? no? ok... </p>
  <br />
  <p> last but not least. Below is an image. This image SHOULD have the padding, margins and borders requested. </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <img src="https://www.serebii.net/Shiny/SWSH/369.png" id="photo" />
  <br />
  <p> What an assignment am I right? Man that was crazy. I feel like Im missing something though...oh right!
    The actual anchor. What a way to finish off right? Well, I hope you enjoyed this ride. More to come next time I
    suppose? hopefully so. Definetly easily. Take care traveller... </p>
